              <h2>Creativity</h2> I believe creavity is one of the most amazing things in the world. Therfore, it's a big part of who I am as a person. I express my creativity through the poems that I write. To give you an example of what I mean I wrote a poem and it should be right under this paragraph. Writing poems allowed me to put on paper what I could not say. It made me a better person, it let me overcome my fears, and it helped me find a way to appreciate everything that happens to me good or bad.

              <h2>School</h2> I take 7 classes: Algebra II, Biology, English, Spanish, AP Human Geo, Health/Fitness, and Web Dev. I start school at 8:00 am - 3:05. I don't have a favorite class because to me they all have something different to give me, so how can I favor one over the other? (Look at me making powerful statements lol). I usually try my hardest to get all A's' because I aspire to be #1. However, the more I learn the more I realize my grades aren't what make me #1. It's my dedication, endurance, and hard work that will <b>have</b> to put me where I want to be! School ahs taught me a lot and I will continue to learn. This is why I love school!

                Where should I go when I just don't know? What do I do when I can't choose? I stay annoyed and confused because my indecisiveness is cruel. It makes easy questions feel like rocket science and difficult ones seem impossible to answer. I hate to say impossible but I don't know what else to say. Even in this piece I feel indecisive.  Should I keep writing or stop. Is it gtting too wordy? Is my point slipping away. I don't know. I shouldn't relt on other people to make decisions for me so is it bad if I ask you what should I do. I don't know. The only thing I know and the only thing I'm sure of is that my indecisiveness is cruel and I don't know what to do.

              <h2>Hard Work</h2> That's my favorite thing to hear. <b>Hard work</b> is one of the bases of who I am. It's something I try to do everyday. I try to give 120% and when I don't I come back the next day even harder and I never stop. If I ever stop then I'm not putting in <b>hard work!</b> My goals are driven by the amount of effort I'm willing to put into them. Currently it's 2:12 am and I'm working on this project. What does that show? It shows I didn't put 120% into this project and that's a <b>HUGE PROBLEM!</b> However, it's something I will learn from. This is who I am. I try my hardest to learn from my mistakes no matter what! I've promised <b>myself</b> that I can not allow this to happen again because I refuse to keep giving half of myself when I can give all of myself!
